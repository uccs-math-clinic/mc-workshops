    "_How do we make decisions?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempts to answer this question in a meaningful way have yielded rich fields of research in disciplines as diverse as biology, philosophy, computational science, and many others. These results have led to Nobel Prizes, Fields Medals, and influence - if not directly control - many facets of our current life as we know it today. As mathematicians, we will of course choose to ignore many of these results and instead direct our attention toward a drastically oversimplified model which we will in turn incrementally build into something vaguely resembling a working decision-making machine.\n",

    "## Simple Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing any useful model, it serves one well to examine the simplest possible non-trivial case, characterize that case fully, and incrementally introduce complexity from there. In our case - wherein we are looking for a mathematical formulation of decision-making - we will begin by examining in generality decisions which admit either a \"yes\" response or a \"no\" response. As it turns out, a great many useful decisions can be made by composing such simple yes/no decisions; in fact, classical computing as we know it today is entirely built upon such yes/no (or more accurately \"binary\") logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, suppose that we have a set of data along with a question for which we hope to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" about. As a very simple example, suppose that we are art museum curators and are tasked with assembling a collection of \"light\" themed paintings. To this end, we might assemble a collection of grayscale paintings and based on the total composition of light paints used in the piece, we may either choose to include it in our collection or not. The decision we must make is whether to include a particular work of art in the collection; in other words, if a painting contains enough light paint, the decision we make is \"yes\" and if it does not, then the answer is \"no\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A function which encodes such logic is called an _activation function_. Activation functions take as input some characteristic of a particular data point (in our example, the amount of \"light\" paint used in a particular piece) and output a particular decision (in our example, whether a particular painting should be included in the themed collection). Perhaps the simplest possible example of such a function might be a step function which outputs `1` (\"yes\") if the input is above a particular threshold $x_0$, and `0` (\"no\") if the function is below that threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "      0 & x \\leq x_0 \\\\\n",
    "      1 & x > x_0 \n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a function is called a _binary activation_ function and is simply a shifted [Heaviside function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function). Given a particular set of data, such a function would classify that data as follows:"

    "## Less Simple Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, of course, decisions are not always quite so black-and-white. In fact, it's quite rare that any particular decision is met with absolute certainty; it's much more often the case that a binary question is met with responses such as \"probably so\", \"maybe not\", etc. Ideally, we'd like to allow for these possibilities in a somewhat natural way. One way in which we can do this is to \"smooth\" out our activation function - by introducing some values other than zero and one, we may introduce some measure of confidence in a particular decision. If we allow for values _between_ zero and one, we can for instance interpret an output value of `0.70` to mean that we are \"70% confident\" that decision resulting from a particular input should be interpreted as a \"yes\". Furthermore, because we're in the business of trying to fit functions to data, we'd like such a function to be optimizable via our gradient descent algorithm. We therefore would like to find a function which we can tweak in a similar way to the linear model which we trained in [Intro_GradientDescent](../02_GradientDescentLinearRegression/Intro_GradientDescent.ipynb); that is, we'd like a function which has parameters which we can tweak, which is differentiable everywhere, and which provides some measure of \"confidence\" about a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, several such functions exist, which each have their own set of limitations, advantages, computational requirements, and (in)efficiencies. In this notebook, we will introdude the [Sigmoid Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function), which satisfies all of our desired behaviors and is defined thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-wx + b}}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The values $w$ and $b$ in machine learning literature are often called the _weight_ and _bias_ of the activation function function, respectively. The first of these values scale the sigmoid function, and the second translates it to the left or to the right; these are analogous to the $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ values which we optimized in our last workshop for linear regression. By adjusting these parameters, we can therefore fit a particular sigmoid function to a set of pre-classified data by way of gradient descent, which we will now proceed to do."
